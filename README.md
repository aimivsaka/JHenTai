## Develop Motivation

My first project With Flutter. I aim at getting familiar with Flutter during development. Devices I use include Android phone and
Ipad, E-hentai apps I used before have several bugs, and I don't understand source code because I have no development experience
with Android or ios, so I choose JHenTai to become my first Flutter Project.

## Translation

1. Copy `/lib/src/l18n/en_US.dart ` and rename to `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode}.dart`
2. Rename classname in new file(optional)
3. Modify k-v pairs in method `keys` ,translate values to your language
4. Enter `/lib/src/l18n/locale_text.dart ` ,add a new k-v pair in method `keys`
   => `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {your_className}.keys()`

## Bug

1. Local cookie file will be broken in some cases, causing login status invalid, and now I don't know why.
In logs, we can see errors like `_hostSet hasn't been initializeed`. 
Can be solved by logout and login again temporarily.


## Main Dart Dependencies
