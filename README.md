## Develop Motivation

My first project With Flutter. I aim at getting familiar with Flutter during development. Devices I use include Android
phone, Ipad and Windows computer. E-hentai apps I used before have several bugs, and I don't understand source code because I have no development
experience
with Android or ios, so I choose JHenTai to become my first Flutter Project.

## Improvement & Todo

## Translation

> [languageCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/language.xml)
>
> [countryCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/region.xml)

1. Copy `/lib/src/l18n/en_US.dart ` and rename to `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode}.dart`

You can only do this and submit your PR, I'll do the remaining things. Or you can go on with:

2. Rename classname in new file(optional)
3. Modify k-v pairs in method `keys` ,translate values to your language
4. Enter `/lib/src/l18n/locale_text.dart ` , add a new k-v pair in method `keys`
   => `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {your_className}.keys()`
5. Enter `/lib/src/consts/locale_consts.dart`, add a new k-v pair in
   property `localeCode2Description`: `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {languageDescription}`

## Bug

1. When the reading page takes the up-to-bottom scrolling direction, there is a very small chance that current page
   number can't
   be synchronized correctly; third-party libraries are involved.
2. Operations related to the clipboard may not work properly on Samsung devices due to a bug in Flutter itself.
3. Change download path to SD card is not supported now.
