## Develop Motivation

My first project With Flutter. I aim at getting familiar with Flutter during development. Devices I use include Android phone and
Ipad, E-hentai apps I used before have several bugs, and I don't understand source code because I have no development experience
with Android or ios, so I choose JHenTai to become my first Flutter Project.
